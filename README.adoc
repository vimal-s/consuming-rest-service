An application that consumes a RESTful web service.

== What It Does

The application uses Spring's `RestTemplate` to retrieve a random Spring Boot quotation
at https://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random.

== Fetching a REST Resource

A RESTful service at https://gturnquist-quoters.cfapps.io/api/random randomly fetches
quotations about Spring Boot and returns them as JSON documents that looks something like this:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
   type: "success",
   value: {
      id: 10,
      quote: "Really loving Spring Boot, makes stand alone Spring apps easy."
   }
}
----
====

== Running the Application

Output similar to the following but with a random quotation:

....
2019-08-22 14:06:46.506  INFO 42940 --- [           main] c.e.c.ConsumingRestApplication           : Quote{type='success', value=Value{id=1, quote='Working with Spring Boot is like pair-programming with the Spring developers.'}}
....
